        <h3>Who is Thomas Shelby?</h3>
        <p>What can I say, he is the mastermind of the great Peaky Blinders.</p>
        <h3>Why is he so special and different from other characters in any show till now?</h3>
        <p>His way of dealing with problems and his persona is what defines him. He has seen a lot of bloodshed and trauma during the first world war. The war has changed him a lot. Almost everything has become a joke to him. Superiority is a joke, Authority is a joke. He is his own revolution.</p>
